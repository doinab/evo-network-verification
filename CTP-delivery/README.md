Note: for each configuration (network size, density, data rate, noise model, table size) 
we have 16 experiments. With an average yield of about 2000 test topologies, the data set is very large.
We have shared one experiment (the one of best result) per configuration.

An archive directory titled explicitly with "symm" has symmetric test topologies; all others are by default asymmetric. "fast" means faster data rate (1 packet per node per second); all other used 1 packet per node per 5 seconds. The number at the end of a directory title (3, 7, 10, etc) is always between 1 and 16, and is the index of that test among the 16 tests for that configuration.
